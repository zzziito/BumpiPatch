## About BumpiPatch

Unlinke indoors where the driving environment is predictable, mobile robots might encounter various road conditions when it is driving outdoors. Mobile robots, which often carry sensitive equipment on their chassis or carry beverages / products (in the case of delivery robots) need to decide where is the stable road even within areas classsified as "traversable area". 
Therefore, by analyzing the correlation between IMU , which can digitalize the moveness of the chassis and heightmap of the road, the goal was to evaluate the driving stability by predicting "less bumpy roads" in advance.
